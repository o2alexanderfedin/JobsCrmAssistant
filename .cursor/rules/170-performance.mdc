# Performance Guidelines

## Code Efficiency
- Consider algorithm complexity
- Avoid unnecessary operations
- Use appropriate data structures
- Optimize critical paths
- Profile when needed
- Cache expensive operations

## Resource Management
- Monitor memory usage
- Clean up resources properly
- Use connection pooling
- Implement timeouts
- Handle rate limits
- Optimize database queries

## Monitoring
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor resource usage
- Set up alerts
- Log performance data
- Track response times
- Monitor error rates

## Optimization Process
- Profile before optimizing
- Measure baseline performance
- Identify bottlenecks
- Implement improvements
- Verify improvements
- Document optimizations
