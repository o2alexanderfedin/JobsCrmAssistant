# Architecture Guidelines

## Project Structure

1. **Source Code Organization**
   - All source code must be under `src/jobs_crm_assistant/`
   - Tests must be under `tests/` directory
   - Configuration files at root level
   - Clear separation of concerns in module organization

2. **Module Organization**
   - `api/` - FastAPI routes and endpoints
   - `core/` - Core business logic and configuration
   - `models/` - Data models and schemas
   - `services/` - Business services
   - `agents/` - AI agent implementations
   - `utils/` - Utility functions

3. **Code Modification Rules**
   - Review relevant code sections before changes
   - Understand current implementation
   - Identify potential side effects
   - Document planned changes
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add appropriate logging
   - Update documentation
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - Run tests after changes
   - Review logs
   - Fix any linter errors
   - Document remaining issues
