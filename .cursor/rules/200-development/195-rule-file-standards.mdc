# Rule File Standards

This document defines the standards and guidelines for creating and maintaining rule files in the Jobs CRM Assistant project.

## 1. File Structure

### 1.1 Required Components
- YAML frontmatter with description, globs, and alwaysApply fields
- Single H1 title matching the rule name
- Overview paragraph explaining purpose
- Logical sections using H2 and H3 headings
- Clear, actionable guidelines

### 1.2 Frontmatter Format
```yaml
---
description: "Clear description of the rule's purpose"
globs: ["file patterns this rule applies to"]
alwaysApply: true/false
---
```

## 2. Content Guidelines

### 2.1 Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Focus on standards and requirements
- Write in active voice
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use numbered lists for sequences

### 2.2 What to Include
- Standards and requirements
- Best practices
- Decision criteria
- Rationale for important rules
- Cross-references to related rules

### 2.3 Code Usage
- **Absolute Minimum**: Include code only when text alone cannot convey the requirement
- Keep code examples under 5% of total content
- Code should illustrate patterns, not implementation
- Always explain why the code example is necessary
- Use pseudo-code when possible instead of actual implementation

### 2.4 What to Avoid
- Implementation details and extensive code samples
- Environment-specific information
- Temporary solutions
- Personal preferences
- Redundant information
- Code that could be explained in plain text

## 3. File Organization

### 3.1 Naming Convention
- Three-digit prefix (NNN)
- Descriptive name in kebab-case
- `.mdc` extension
Example: `195-rule-file-standards.mdc`

### 3.2 Category Ranges
- 000-099: Core/Global rules
- 100-199: Development standards
- 200-299: Process guidelines
- 300-399: Technical standards
- 400-499: Team guidelines

## 4. Maintenance

### 4.1 Review Process
- Quarterly reviews required
- Update outdated content
- Remove obsolete guidelines
- Add missing standards
- Validate against current practices

### 4.2 Version Control
- Track changes in git
- Clear commit messages
