# Testing Guidelines

## Testing Protocol
- Run affected tests after each change
- Add new test cases for edge cases
- Ensure all tests pass before committing
- Maintain test coverage
- Add tests for new features
- Update existing tests as needed

## Test Organization
- Tests mirror source code structure
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests in classes
- Use appropriate test fixtures
- Keep tests focused and atomic

## Test Types
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interaction
- API tests for endpoints
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Security tests for vulnerabilities

## Test Quality
- Write clear test descriptions
- Use meaningful assertions
- Mock external dependencies
- Handle edge cases
- Test error conditions
- Maintain test data separately
