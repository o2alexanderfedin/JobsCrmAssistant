# Dependency Management

## Package Management
- Use `pyproject.toml` for project metadata and dependencies
- Maintain separate requirements files:
  - `requirements.txt` for production dependencies
  - `requirements-dev.txt` for development dependencies
- Pin dependency versions for reproducibility
- Document dependency purposes in comments

## Framework Usage
- FastAPI for API development
- Pydantic for data validation
- Loguru for logging
- OpenAI for AI capabilities
- LangChain for LLM integration
- pytest for testing

## Version Control
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Test with latest compatible versions
- Document version constraints
- Review security advisories
- Update dependencies regularly
